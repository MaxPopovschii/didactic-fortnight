# Data Types in C


This folder contains simple implementations of common data structures in C:

- List (dynamic array)
- LinkedList (singly linked list)
- DoublyLinkedList (doubly linked list)
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)
- Tree (binary search tree)
- Map (hash table with open addressing)
- Set (hash set)
- PriorityQueue (min-heap)
- CircularBuffer (fixed-size ring buffer)
- Deque (double-ended queue)
- BitSet (bit array)
- Heap (max-heap)
- Trie (prefix tree for strings)
- Graph (adjacency matrix)

## Build

```sh
make
```

## Run

```sh
./data-types
```

Each data structure is implemented in its own .c/.h file and demonstrated in main.c.
